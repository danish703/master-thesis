	title = {Fatigue Detection For Online Classes Based on Adaboost},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {Online Classes has been widely popularized since corona virus doesnâ€™t allow students to have face-to-face classes. However, due to comfortable environment that students have, students may get sleepy in class and cannot help with their fatigue. So students need a supervised environment to alarm them not to fall asleep. So in this article, a real-time method to detect whether the student in front of the camera is sleeping, based on the demo of students in online classes, is introduced. This article focus on detection of states of eyes of students. It uses Adaboost as the training method to detect the face of the student, uses Canny to process the picture with human face, and calculates the area of the exposed eyeball and the radius of the eye. Finally, PERCLOS is used as the criterion to determine whether the student is sleeping in class. The method in this article has high detection rate on faces and eyes, which is respectively 99.7% and 98.5% for image set that made by the author. It can be applied on online classes and shows good results in detecting the fatigue of people in practical.}
